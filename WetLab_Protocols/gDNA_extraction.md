# gDNA Extraction 

## Materials:
* Qiagen DNEasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, 69504)
* RNAse A (20mg/mL, PureLink RNase A, Life Technology, 12091021)
* TE buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH8, 1mM EDTA)
* HAP1 cell pellet

### Method:
1.	Make sure each sample is maximum 10m HAP1 cells (ideally 3-5M). If necessary, re-suspend pellet in DPBS(-/-) and remove 10m cells/100ul DPBS. If less than 1M, do NOT use this kit. Instead purify by bead purification. 
2.	Set heat block to 37 C 
3.	Resuspend pellet in 400µl TE buffer (Or if cells are in 100µl PBS, add 300µl TE buffer to the sample)
4.	Add 10µl RNAse A (Puralink – in fridge). 
5.	Incubate at 37 C for 15 minutes. Once finished, set to 56 C
6.	Add 40µl Proteinase K
7.	Add 400µl Buffer AL. Mix thoroughly by pipetting.
8.	Incubate at 56 C for 15 minutes
9.	Add 400µl Ethanol (80-100%). Mix thoroughly.
10.	Mix the mixture by pipetting up and down for 5 times. Pipet 700uL of the mixture into one DNEasy Mini spin column placed in a 2ml collection tube. Centrifuge at 9500 rpm for 1 minute.
11.	Discard the flow-through add the rest of the lysate to the same column. Centrifuge at 9500 rpm for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and the collection tube.
12.	Place the spin column in a new collection tube. Add 500µl Buffer AW1. Centrifuge at 9500 rpm for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and the collection tube.
13.	Place the spin column in a new collection tube. Add 500µl Buffer AW2. Centrifuge at 13 200 rpm for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through.
14.	Centrifuge another 2 minutes at 13 200 rpm. Discard the flow-through and the collection tube.
15.	Place the spin column into a new 1.5ml tube.
16.	To avoid ethanol contamination of the extracted gDNA, clear all remaining wash buffer from the o-ring of the spin column using a p200 pipette.
17.	Elute the DNA by adding 100µl Buffer AE to the center of the spin column.
18.	Incubate at room temperature for >5 minute.
19.	Centrifuge at 13 200 rpm for 1 minute.
20.	Measure concentration of sample using Nanodrop. (Ideally should be between 100-400ng/ul)
