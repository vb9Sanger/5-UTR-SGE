# Gel Purification:

1. Excise bands from gel
2. Weigh gel slice in 1.5ml tube
3. If gel slice is less than or equal to 200mg, add 3 volumes of QG buffer to 1.5ml tube
   * Otherwise, add 3 volumes of QG buffer to 15ml falcon tube
4. Incubate at 50C for 10min (or until gel fully dissolves)
    * vortex every 2min
5. Add 1 volume of isopropanol
    * Mix by inverting
6. *If using 1.5 ml tubes:*
    * Add 700ul of sample to minelute column (stored in fridge)
    * Spin at full speed for 1min
    * Discard flow through
    * Add rest of sample to column
    * Spin for 1min
    * Discard flow through
  * *If using 15ml falcon:*
    * Add sample to minelute column connected to vaccum pump
    * Return to collection tube
7. Add 500ul of QG buffer
    * Spin at full speed for 1min
    * Discard flow through
8. Add 750ul of Buffer PE
    * Spin at full speed for 1min
    * Discard flow through
9. Place column back in centrifuge
    * Spin for 2min
10. Clear o-ring, then place in new 1.5ml tube
11. Elute in 12ul EB buffer
    * Let stand for 2min
    * Centrifuge full speed for 1min
12. Nanodrop
