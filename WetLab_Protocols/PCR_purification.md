# PCR Purification:

### Notes:
* For Minelute PCR purification (of amplified TWIST olgios), use refirigerated columns
* For PCR purification of ILL1 DNA, use columns from kit

### Protocol: 
1.	Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of PCR Reaction and mix (e.g. 50ul Rxn = 250ul Buffer PB)
  * If solution is orange or violet, add 10% PCR volume of 3M sodium acetate (e.g. add 5ul to a 50ul PCR reaction). Solution should turn yellow
2.	Place column (from fridge) in 2ml collection tube
3.	Apply sample to column 
4.	Centrifuge top speed for 30s
5. Discard flow-through
6.	Add 750ul of Buffer PE to column 
7.	Centrifuge top speed for 30s
8. Discard flow-through 
9.	Centrifuge again at top speed for 2min to remove residual wash buffer
10.	Remove ethanol from o-ring then place column in fresh 1.5ml tube 
11.	Add 12ul of EB Buffer to column
12. Let stand for 2min
13.	Centrifuge top speed for 1min 
14.	Nanodrop
