# Bead Purification

## ILL2 DNA: 
1.	Warm Ampure XP beads to room temp (~30min)
2.	Vortex Ampure XP bead to resuspend 
3.	Add 90ul of resuspended beads to 100ul PCR reaction (in 1.5ul tube)
4.	Mix well by pipetting 
5.	Incubate samples on bench top for 15min at room temp
  * Meanwhile, prepare 10ul of 80% ethanol 
6.	Place tubes on magnetic stand to separate beads from supernatant 
7.	After 5min, remove whole volume (1000ul) of supernatant
  * Careful not to touch beads
8.	Add 300ul of 80% ethanol to tubes while in the magnetic stand 
  * Incubate at room temp for 30sec
  * Remove supernatant 
9.	Repeat step 8
10.	Spin tubes at 1000rpm for 10sec
11.	Place tubes back on magnetic stand and remove residual ethanol with p10 pipette
12.	Air dry beads (with lid open) for up to 5min
  *	Ensure beads do not over-dry and become light in colour 
13.	Remove tubes from magnetic stand 
14.	Elute DNA in 33ul of EB Buffer 
  *	Make sure to get all beads off wall of tube
  *	Mix well by pipetting 
15.	Incubate for 10min at room temp
16.	Place tubes back on magnetic stand
17.	After ~1min transfer 30ul to new tubes 
18.	Qubit 
19.	Store at -20
