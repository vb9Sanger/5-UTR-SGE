# NeonNxt electroporation in Hap1 cells 
## Version 0 (April 2024) written by Malin – modified by Vanessa 

### Material:
Hap1 cells (Clone A5, Cas9+ Lig4-)
Hap1 media (IMDM + 10% FBS) w/o antibiotics
TrypLE Express
PBS
Countess slides/haemocytometer (in drawer)
Neon pipette & Neon Electroporation Kit (100ul): tips, Neon tubes (in cabinet)
buffer R, electrode buffer (in fridge)
Guide/library plasmids
Sterile 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes (on desk beside malin’s)

### Notes: 
* Do not use any antibiotics in the media during the electroporation (pen/strep, blasticidin, etc)!
* On D0, you should have at least 10x T150s grown to ~60-70% confluency PER TARGETON

1.	Wash cells with PBS (T150 = 10ml)
2.	Add trypLE to labware and incubate for 3 minutes @37C (for T150 = 3ml)
3.	Collect cells in (T150 = 7ml) Hap1 media (no antibiotics) into sterile 250ml bottle
1.	if using 5 flasks or less, use a 50ml falcon tube for collection instead
2.	ensure dissociation of cells clumps by titration 3-4 times, for accurate counting
4.	Count cells using the countess. (10ul cells + 10ul Trypan blue). Take two counts. If they deviate with 10+%, re-suspend the collection buffer and count again. If the live counts are above 5e6/ml, add more media to the suspension and count again.
1.	For 4 replicates + excess: 10m * 4.5 = 45m cells
2.	For 3 replicates (GFP control): 10m * 3.5 = 35m cells 
5.	Transfer the required number of cells to a falcon tube (i.e. 10M cells/replicate. Remember to include pipetting excess). If more than 1 replicate, 50ml falcon. Otherwise 10ml. 
6.	Centrifuge 1000rpm for 3 minutes
7.	Aspirate media and re-suspend cell pellet in 5ml of PBS
8.	Centrifuge 1000rpm for 3 minutes
9.	Aspirate PBS and re-suspend cells in appropriate volume of buffer R* (ie 100ul/replicate. Remember to include pipetting excess) e.g. 3 replicates with excess = 350ul
10.	Transfer cell R suspension to a sterile 1.5ml Eppendorf tube, label
11.	Add required amount of plasmid* (use 2.7ug guide, 5.3ug library and 100ng pMax GFP per replicate). 

|  | Guide | Library | pMax GFP| 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 4 replicates (* 4.5) | 12.15ug	|23.85ug|	450ng|
| 3 replicates GFP only (* 3.5) | -	|-|	28ug|

### Notes: 
* Transfection efficiency might be reduced if the DNA amount is above 10% of the reaction volume (10ul per replicate, or 45ul for 4.5). Ensure amount of guide + library per replicate is less than 15% total volume (150ul). If it does, you should consider concentrating your plasmids.

12.	Set up the pipetting station inside the hood and turn on the computer unit (off switch on the back). The grey connector cable should be unplugged and MUST be inserted with arrow marking facing UP. The right-hand side of the touch screen (after turning on and pressing quick run to open the experiment set up screen) should show that the pipette unit is connected with an empty circle when this is done correctly.
13.	Add 2ml of Buffer E/electrode buffer to the Neon tube and insert into the Electroporation station. (Ensure cathode faces the back). You should hear a click when it’s correctly in place.
14.	Prepare the new cell culture plate/labware by adding media (15ml to T75) – 1 flask per replicate
15.	Before each different sample, carefully pipette DNA/cell suspension to mix using a p200/p1000 pipette (do NOT mix with Neon pipette)
16.	Attach tip to NeonNxt pipette by pressing the pipette down (do not press plunger). Make sure there is no gap between the tip and the pipette. Note – this click-tip pipette is different to the old Neon pipette!
17.	Press the plunger fully down until you hear the pipette click, then release the plunger. The gold insert should separate so it moves up and down with the plunger.
18.	Carefully pipette the reaction mix up using the Neon pipette. Important: Make sure there are no bubbles in the pipette tip, or the electroporation will not work! – could be at bottom or top of tip
19.	Transfer the pipette to the electroporation station. You should hear a click when it’s correctly in place.
20.	Set up the correct electroporation settings on the computer unit and press start. (1600 Voltage, 1 pulse, 30ms). Note – you will receive a warning on the machine the setting might cause arcing. You can ignore this warning.
21.	After delivering the electric pulse, a green tick (for success) or red x (for failure) is displayed on the right-hand side of the touchscreen to indicate that electroporation is complete. Note – the visual feedback of the previous neon machine (bubble/click for success or spark for failure) is not visible on this machine.
22.	Carefully remove the Neon pipette from the station. Pipette the electroporated cells into the cell culture vessel with media (from step 14) by pressing down to the first stop only – pipette directly into media
23.	To remove the tip, press the blue release lever (it might click) and THEN press the plunger fully down. Swap tips between each electroporation. Each Neon tube with E buffer can be used for up to 3 electroporations. Swap tip/buffer between different samples (biological samples/plasmids). 
24.	Label flasks and gently agitate the plate/flask to spread the cells evenly before transferring it to the incubator.
25.	OPTIONAL STEP: if non-puro treated samples are required (e.g. for GFP FACS) you can remove 0.5-1ml of the suspension from the mixed flask and plate in a multiwell dish. This sample can then be grown/treated independently of the screening replicate.

### Note:
* Remember to seed a puromycin kill control. This can be GFP-only EP cells, or leftover Hap1 cells.
