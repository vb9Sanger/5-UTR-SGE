# SGE Screening Protocol (No weekends):

## <ins>Day 1-2: Selection</ins>

### Materials:
Hap1 media (IMDM + 10% FBS)
Blasticidin
Puromycin
Penicillin/Streptomycin (optional)

### Notes: 
* From this day onward, you can put pen/strep in the media as an extra precaution for preventing contamination (using pen/strep does NOT replace using good sterile technique!). If you do decide to use pen/strep, use it the whole way throughout the screening process. 
* Pen/Strep is used at 1% working concentration (ie 5.5ml for a 550ml bottle of media). 

1.	24-30 hours after the electroporation, change the media to Hap1 media + 10ug/ml blasticidin + 2ug/ml puromycin
2.	Take a picture of each replicate using the EVOS
a.	Find a representative area of cells and focus
b.	Click the “freeze” button either by clicking on screen with the mouse or using the button on the front
c.	Click the “settings” icon on screen with the mouse and make sure Quick Save is turned OFF
d.	Attach a usb to the outlet (right hand side of screen)
e.	Click save (a pop-up will let you name the file)
3.	The next day, repeat steps 1 & 2


## <ins>Day 3: Media change</ins>

### Materials:
Hap1 media (IMDM + 10% FBS)
Blasticidin
Penicillin/Streptomycin (optional)

1.	After 48 hours of puromycin selection, change the media to Hap1 media + 10ug/ml blasticidin


## <ins>Day 4: Split & harvest</ins>

### Materials:
3x T150 per replicate 
Hap1 media (IMDM + 10% FBS)
Blasticidin
Penicillin/Streptomycin (optional)
TrypLE Express
PBS(-/-)
Countess slides/haemocytometer + Trypan Blue
Preprinted labels for your harvest tubes containing targeton name, screen timepoint, date


1.	Take a picture of the cells using the EVOS (see above for detailed instructions)
2.	Wash cells once with PBS (10ml)
3.	Add 2ml trypLE to each T75 and incubate for 3 minutes at 37C
4.	Add 8ml of Hap1 media to each flask and collect into a falcon tube
5.	Count cells using the countess. Take two counts. If they deviate by 10+%, re-suspend the collection buffer and count again. If the live counts are above 5e6/ml, add more media to the suspension and count again.
6.	For each replicate, 
a.	aliquot 5m cells into one Falcon tube and label it for re-seeding
b.	aliquot 6m cells into another Falcon tube and label it for harvest
c.	If your cell numbers are insufficient, please refer to the end of this protocol for a guide on how to proceed
7.	Centrifuge tubes at 300rcf for 3 minutes

**Re-Seeding:**
8.	For each replicate, prepare 3x T150 flasks with Hap1 media + 10ug/ml blasticidin
9.	Aspirate the supernatant media from the re-seeding pellet and re-suspend it in 3ml Hap1 media
10.	Put 1ml each of the cell suspension into the prepared T150s (~1.7m cells/flask). Gently agitate the flask and transfer them to the incubator

**Harvests:**
11.	Aspirate the supernatant media from the harvest pellet and re-suspend in 2ml PBS
12.	Put 1ml each into two Eppendorf tubes*
13.	Spin the Eppendorfs in the microcentrifuge for 1 min
14.	Aspirate the PBS carefully without disturbing the pellet
15.	Immediately snap-freeze pellets on dry ice, or transfer them to a box in the -80C freezer (for safety, do not store SGE screen pellets in your own -20 freezers)

### Notes:
* If you are submitting DNA pellets to pipelines, you should use 2ml Eppendorf tubes. If we are processing DNA/library prep in our lab you can use either 1.5ml or 2ml tubes. This applies to all timepoints.

4.	Add 7ml of Hap1 media to each flask and collect into a falcon tube
5.	Count cells using the countess. Take two counts. If they deviate by 10+%, re-suspend the collection buffer and count again. If the live counts are above 5e6/ml, add more media to the suspension and count again.
